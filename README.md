I'll be creating my own virtual pet! Will have plenty of features. For example:
Feed Pet
Walk to increase fitness
Aging
Hunger
Name and so on.
------------------
This is my first project so I'm very excited to get going and try things out!

Added an aging function. Age starts at 0 and then increases by 1 for each pet.growUp()
Added hunger, feed to decrease hunger level.
Aging now also increases hunger level.
Added walking, walking increases fitness level.
